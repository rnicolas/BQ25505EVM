# BQ25570EVM

The working files of this component need [this library](https://github.com/rnicolas/Battery_Management) to be added into your library.

If you just want the gerber files to build this PCB on your own, just download this [zip](https://github.com/rnicolas/BQ25570EVM/blob/master/output/bq25570evm.zip?raw=true). Board is still on development and some tests are still needed, so use it at your own risk.
